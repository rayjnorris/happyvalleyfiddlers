                            <h3>The Kruger Brothers</h3>
                            <div class="w-richtext">
                                <p>Born and raised in Europe, brothers Jens and Uwe Kruger started singing and playing instruments at a very young age. Growing up in a family where music was an important part of life, they were exposed to a wide diversity of musical influences. The brothers were performing regularly by the time they were eleven and twelve years old, and they began their professional career in 1979. Jens’ and Uwe’s first public performances were as a duo, and in just a few years they were busking on the streets of cities throughout eastern and western Europe.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>CBS Records contracted with Jens and Uwe when Jens was just seventeen years old, and shortly thereafter, the Krugers hosted a radio show on SRG SSR, the Swiss Public broadcast group.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Several years later, the brothers teamed up with bass player Joel Landsberg, a native of New York City who also had a very extensive musical upbringing in classical and jazz music (studying with jazz great Milt Hinton), thus forming a trio that has been playing professionally together since 1995.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Together, they established the incomparable sound that The Kruger Brothers are known for today. The trio moved to the United States in 2002 and is based in Wilkesboro, NC.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Since their formal introduction to American audiences in 1997, The Kruger Brothers’ remarkable discipline, creativity and their ability to infuse classical music into folk music has resulted in a unique sound that has made them a fixture within the world of acoustic music.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>The honesty of their writing has since become a hallmark of the trio’s work.
In their ever-expanding body of work – Jens Kruger (banjo and vocals), Uwe Kruger (guitar and lead vocals), and Joel Landsberg (bass and vocals) – The Kruger Brothers personify the spirit of exploration and innovation that forms the core of the American musical tradition.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Their original music is crafted around their discerning taste, and the result is unpretentious, cultivated, and delightfully fresh.
In addition to their regular concert schedule, The Kruger Brothers perform these classical pieces regularly with select symphony orchestras and string quartets throughout the country.
Through their numerous CD releases, radio and television performances, lectures, and collaborative efforts, The Kruger Brothers’ powerful artistic statement continues to inspire and enlighten audiences and musicians around the world.</p>

                                <p>Laura Boosinger has won glowing reviews wherever she appears and is blessed with an ‘essence of the mountains’ spirit that can take you back to the good old days when folks used to huddle around the radio.

                            <div class="w-richtext">
                                <p>Simply put, Alice Gerrard is a talent of legendary status. In a career spanning some 40 years, she has known, learned from, and performed with many of the old-time and bluegrass greats and has in turn earned worldwide respect for her own important contributions to the music.<br><br>
Alice is particularly known for her groundbreaking collaboration with Appalachian singer Hazel Dickens during the 1960s and ’70s. The duo produced four classic LPs (recently reissued by Rounder on CD) and influenced scores of young women singers — even The Judds acknowledge Hazel and Alice as an important early inspiration.<br><br>
Alice’s two solo albums, Pieces of My Heart, and Calling Me Home were released on the Copper Creek label in 1995 and 2004, respectively, to critical acclaim in Billboard, Bluegrass Unlimited, New Country, and other publications. These superb recordings showcase Alice’s many talents: her compelling, eclectic songwriting; her powerful, hard-edged vocals; and her instrumental mastery on rhythm guitar, banjo, and old-time fiddle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>As a musician, Alice has appeared on more than 20 recordings, including projects with many traditional musicians such as Tommy Jarrell, Enoch Rutherford, Otis Burris, and Matokie Slaughter; as an expert with in-depth knowledge of mountain music, she has produced or written liner notes for a dozen more. She also co-produced and appeared in two documentary films.<br><br>
A tireless advocate of traditional music, Alice has won numerous honors, including an International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) Distinguished Achievement Award, a Virginia Arts Commission Award, the North Carolina Folklore Society’s Tommy Jarrell Award, and an Indy&nbsp;Award.<br>
In 1987 Alice founded the Old-Time Herald and the Old-Time Music Group, a non-profit organization that oversees publication of The Old-Time Herald. Alice served as editor-in-chief of The Old-Time Herald from 1987 till 2003.<br><br>
Alice performs and tours regularly with Tom Sauber and Brad Leftwich as Tom, Brad &amp; Alice. When she can, she performs with the Herald Angels and the Harmony Sisters, and very occasionally with Hazel Dickens. Along with Mark Weems, she has recently formed the Weems Gerrard Band, a local band which specializes in country/honky tonk and original material.</p>

                                <p>Robert Lynn "Bobby" McMillon, a North Carolina Folk Heritage Award recipient, was heir to numerous strands of Appalachian culture. From his father's family in Cocke County, Tennessee, he learned Primitive Baptist hymns and traditional stories and ballads. From his mother's people in Yancy and Mitchell Counties, North Carolina, he heard "booger tales, haint tales," and legends about the murder of a relative named Charlie Silver. In Caldwell County, he went to school with relatives of Tom Dula, learned their family stories, and heard ballads, gospel songs, and Carter family recordings. "The real storytelling," Bobby says, "was so intertwined that a bear tale or a fish tale or a witch tale or a tale of some history that had really happened—a family tale—they were all equally believable."</p>
                                <p>

During that time they have played at festivals, clubs, restaurants, coffee houses, and private venues throughout the Carolinas and Virginia. <br><br>Danny Wicker, the King of the Piedmont Guitar, has developed a powerful finger and slide technique that harkens back to the golden age of Southeastern acoustic blues of the 20's and 30's. He counts among his heroes Rev. Gary Davis, Blind Willie McTell, and Blind Blake but his style is truly his own creation, sometimes pounding out a dance tune, sometimes caressing a ballad. <br><br>&nbsp;Mel Jones brings a rhythmic, melodic harmonica, percussion, and a storyteller's soul to the duo as well as original blues compositions that make the traditional blues of the Carolinas live again to the beat of our millennium. A seasoned entertainer, Mel has won many regional harp competitions and has toured with numerous R&amp;B, blues, and Americana bands throughout the Southeast.<br><br>Together they have released two CD's and have twice won the Charlotte Blues Society's competition to advance to the International Blues Challenge in Memphis. </p>
