Described as “Original, front porch, Appalachian swing tunes played by happy people”, Bob Sinclair and The Big Deals would really like to join you at this year's Convention.  \r\n \r\nWe were just featured at Winterfest at the COMMA in Morganton, NC (with Jon Stickley and Mispo) and The Top of The Grade Music Series in Saluda!   Our new CD will be out later this season and we have a nice tour schedule throughout the summer – plus, a Colorado tour is in the works.  Fun stuff for our little troupe!\r\n•         Sinclair first came into the national spotlight when he was selected as a Merlefest Emerging Artist and as a three time award winner of the NC Grassroots Artists awards for songwriting and performance.\r\n•         Molly Barrett’s superb fiddle and vocal work are an integral part of the signature sound of this group.  Molly is a happy and talented band mate, an in-demand session player and has multiple fiddle contest awards throughout the south! \r\n•         Tim Gallagher is an expressive mandolin player with a diverse musical resume.  Tim also covers second fiddle on multiple tunes to give the band a Big Deal Symphony sound! \r\n•         Jim Clark is a veteran of the Americana festival scene and one of the most in-demand bassists around.  He’s rock solid!\r\n•         Aaron Ramsey often joins the band on guitar, bass and vocals when not touring with Mountain Heart.  A man with great energy and talent, he’s our go-to record producer and a Big Deal!\r\n\r\nOther information can be found at www.bobsinclairmusic.com  \r\n\r\nIf you want to see what we are all about, then please come see us!\r\n*    Purple Onion – Saluda, NC – Saturday, Jun 17th\r\n*    185 King Street Music Hall – Brevard, NC – Friday, June 30th \r\n*    Jonesborough Music on The Square – Jonesborough, TN – Friday, July 14th \r\n*    Muddy Creek Music Hall - Winston Salem, NC – Sunday, August 27th\r\n\r\nThanks for considering us. \r\n \r\n \r\nBob"
